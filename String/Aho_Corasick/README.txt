    To use the FindAllQueries program, first do the compilation procedure. To compile the program, just type make in the terminal where the source codes are located. After compilation, to run the program, type in terminal, “./FindAllQueries <dictionary filename> <database filename>” where the files are located. If any arguments are missing, in the stderr, it will print out prompt that shows the error. For the error of wrong file name, the program will not run correctly. If no
    problem is found, after a while, the program will print out the result in stdout.
